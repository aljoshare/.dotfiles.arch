A customized version of [CachyOS i3wm settings](https://github.com/CachyOS/cachyos-i3wm-settings), themed with [Catppuccin Frappe](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) across all components.

## Window Management

[i3](https://i3wm.org/) handles tiling and workspaces with vim-style navigation (`hjkl`). Windows get rounded corners and smooth fade animations through [Picom](https://github.com/yshui/picom), which also provides transparency and a slight background blur.

## Status Bar

[Polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar) sits at the top of the screen showing workspaces, pending Arch package updates, current weather via OpenWeatherMap, and a live typing speed indicator.

## Launcher and Notifications

[Rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) serves as the application launcher, styled to match the Catppuccin palette. [Dunst](https://dunst-project.org/) handles desktop notifications with matching colors and the Hack font.

## Terminal

[Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) runs at 80% opacity with an underline cursor and Catppuccin colors. The default shell is launched in a 100x30 grid.

## Editors

[micro](https://micro-editor.github.io/) is configured with the Catppuccin Frappe theme and ships with syntax highlighting for ~140 languages. [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) provides a quick terminal UI for Git.
